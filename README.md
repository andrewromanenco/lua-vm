# LUA VM: lua interpreter in TypeScript

**LuaVM** is a safe, sandboxed Lua interpreter implemented in TypeScript. It is designed to be easily embedded in TypeScript/JavaScript applications or web environments (also referred to as **host systems**).

The virtual machine executes Lua code without any ability to access or affect the host environment. There are **no escape hatches**: Lua code cannot invoke arbitrary host functions or manipulate memory outside the VM. There is **no DOM** access.

## Design Philosophy

The **host system** controls the entire lifecycle of Lua code execution. A typical usage pattern looks like this:

1. Initialize the VM
	- Create a new VM instance.
	- Set up the initial memory state (e.g., define global variables or register host-provided functions).
2. Execute Lua Code
	- Provide a Lua source string.
	- Set an upper limit on the number of instructions to guard against infinite loops.
3. Access Results
	- After execution, inspect return values or query the VMâ€™s memory state (e.g., read variable values).

## Architecture

At its core, **LuaVM** consists of a **pure interpreter** that operates on an abstract syntax tree (AST) generated from Lua code. It uses a plain TypeScript map to store runtime variables.

- The interpreter is **fully isolated** from the host environment.
- It does not access the DOM, browser APIs, or any external resources.
- The interpreter is wrapped by a higher-level VM layer that simplifies integration into host applications.

This strict separation ensures **safe and predictable behavior** in embedded contexts like browsers, games, or Node.js scripts.

## Features

- Set variables in the Lua VM before execution.
- Read variables after execution completes.
- Provide external (TypeScript/JavaScript) functions callable from Lua.
- Enforce a configurable instruction limit to prevent infinite loops.
- Optionally include a subset of standard Lua library functions.
- Supported Types: nil, boolean, number, string, function, and table.
- All LuaVM values are TypeScript-wrapped primitives; behavior is aligned with **JS semantics**.


### Limitations
- Unsupported Features:
	- userdata, thread, and coroutines
	- Metatables
	- Closures
	- Attributes

##  Concept

### VMBuilder: Creating a Virtual Machine

The `VMBuilder` class is the entry point for constructing a Lua VM instance.

- **Create a basic VM:**
  ```ts
  const vm = new VMBuilder().build();
  ```
- **Create a VM with a subset of Lua standard library functions:**
  ```ts
  const vm = new VMBuilder().withStdLib().build();
  ```

A VM instance created via `VMBuilder` acts as a container for **execution threads**. These threads are not concurrent or parallel (LuaVM does not support real multithreading); instead, they represent **independent memory contexts**. This design allows you to run multiple isolated Lua programs using a single VM instance.

### VM-Level Variable Management

- **Set a global variable available to all threads:**
  ```ts
  vm.setLuaVar(StringValue.from("varName"), NumberValue.from(42));
  ```
  This variable will be visible in all threads created from this VM.

> **Note:** If you assign a `TableValue`, it is passed **by reference**. This allows threads to communicate via shared tables. If isolation is required, consider setting variables at the thread level instead.

### One-Off Execution

- **Execute Lua code in a temporary thread and get the result:**
  ```ts
  const result = vm.executeOnce("return 1 + 2");
  ```
  This is a shortcut that internally creates a thread, executes the code, and returns the result.

### Threads: Isolated Execution Contexts

- **Create a new thread:**
  ```ts
  const thread = vm.newThread();
  ```

A thread is an isolated environment with its own memory. It is **not** a system thread or a parallel task. All Lua variables for this execution context reside within the threadâ€™s memory.

- **Set a thread-specific variable:**
  ```ts
  thread.setLuaVar(StringValue.from("varName"), NumberValue.from(100));
  ```

- **Execute Lua code in a thread:**
  ```ts
  const result = thread.execute("return 45*10");
  ```

  - Threads retain memory between executions.
  - You can call `execute(...)` multiple times with different code snippets.
  - The host system can inspect or modify memory using `getLuaVar` and `setLuaVar` between executions.

### Accessing Execution Results

An execution result provides information about the outcome of Lua code:

```ts
if (result.hasReturnValue()) {
  const values = result.returnValueAsList(); // A TypeScript array (0-based index)
}
```

- **Access global variables after execution:**
  ```ts
  const message = result.globalVar("message");
  ```

### Working with LuaVM Types

All values exchanged between the host system and the VM must use **LuaVM types**, which are lightweight wrappers around TypeScript primitives:

- `NilValue`
- `BooleanValue`
- `NumberValue`
- `StringValue`
- `TableValue`
- `FunctionValue`
- `ExtFunction` (for host-defined functions)

#### ðŸ§ª Example: Creating Lua-compatible values

```ts
const count = NumberValue.from(42);
console.log(count.number); // 42
```

### Function Support in LuaVM

LuaVM supportsÂ **functions as first-class values**, with two distinct types representing them:

####Â `FunctionValue`

Represents a functionÂ **defined within the Lua code**Â itself.

- This type is created internally by the VM when Lua code declares a function.    
- In most cases, the host system shouldÂ **not need to create or manipulate**Â `FunctionValue`Â instances directly.

####Â `ExtFunction`

Represents anÂ **external (host-defined) function**Â exposed to the Lua runtime.
- Use this type to inject TypeScript/JavaScript functions into the Lua environment.
- These functions can be used toÂ **extend the capabilities of Lua code**, for example to interact with APIs, custom logic, or host-specific resources.

### ðŸ“¦ Installation

#### As an NPM Package (for Node.js/TypeScript projects):
```bash
npm install lua-vm
```

#### As a JavaScript Library (for use in web apps):

1. Download the latest `lua-vm.js` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/andrewromanenco/lua-vm-ts/releases).
2. _OR_ build it from source:
   ```bash
   npm run buildjs
   ```
3. See [demo.html](https://github.com/andrewromanenco/lua-vm-ts/blob/main/demo.html) for an example of integration in a browser environment.

## STDLIB

The [StdLib](https://github.com/andrewromanenco/lua-vm-ts/tree/main/src/stdlib) is a curated subset of Luaâ€™s standard library, reimplemented as ExtFunctions in TypeScript.

These functions are designed to be safe and sandboxedâ€”they do not access the host environment (no DOM, no browser APIs, no external side effects).

As a reminder, LuaVM types are lightweight wrappers around native TypeScript types. Many functions in the StdLib are simply proxy calls to underlying TypeScript implementations, adapted to work seamlessly with LuaVMâ€™s type system and execution model.

Feel free to browse the src/stdlib directory for examples and inspiration for building your own ExtFunctions.
